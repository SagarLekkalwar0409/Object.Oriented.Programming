Polymorphism in Java is a concept by which we can perform a single action in different ways.
Polymorphism is derived from 2 Greek words: poly and morphs. The word "poly" means many
and "morphs" means forms. So polymorphism means many forms.

There are 2 types of Polymorphism.
1. Compile time Polymorphism : (method overloading): same method name with different parameter
2. Runtime Polymorphism : (method overriding) :subclass provides a specific implementation of a
                                                method that is already provided by its superclass
