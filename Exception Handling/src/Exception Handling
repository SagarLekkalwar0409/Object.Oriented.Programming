What is Exception Handling ?
Ans : Exception is runtime interruption which is stop the program Execution.
      (Exception is an Abnormal Condition).

      In Java, an Exception is an event that disrupts the normal flow of the
      of the program. it is an Object which is thrown the runtime.

      Exception can be suppressed or handled so that program can continue its execution. Exception
      Handling is a mechanism to handle runtime errors such as ClassNotFoundException, IOException,
      SQLException, RemoteException, etc

2) Types of Exception?
Ans : a. Checked Exception
      b. Unchecked Exception.

      a. Checked Exception
      checked exception is an exception that is checked at compile time. This means that the compiler
      checks that the code handles these exceptions either by catching them with a try-catch block or
      by declaring that the method throws these exceptions using the throws keyword.

      b. Unchecked Exception
      An unchecked exception in Java is an unexpected problem that happens while a program is running.
      Unlike checked exceptions, which must be handled by the programmer, unchecked exceptions don't need
      to be explicitly handled. They often occur due to programming mistakes or unexpected conditions,
      like trying to use a null value or accessing an array element that doesn't exist.
